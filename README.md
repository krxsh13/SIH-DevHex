# Digital Platform for Centralized Alumni Data Management and Engagement

## 📌 Problem Description
Many educational institutions lack a reliable and centralized system to manage alumni data. Once students graduate, their contact information, academic records, and career updates are often scattered across multiple platforms or lost entirely. Communication is usually limited to informal WhatsApp groups or outdated mailing lists, making long-term engagement difficult.

This absence of a structured system creates a gap in outreach, mentorship, collaborations, and fundraising opportunities.
